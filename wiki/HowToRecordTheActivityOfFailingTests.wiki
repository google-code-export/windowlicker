If you are using Linux, you can use the listener feature of JUnit to wrap "recordmydesktop", showing you what happens when the tests are running.

Add this to the `<junit>` ant task

{{{
   <formatter classname="com.objogate.wl.build.RecordingFormatter"/>
}}}


The code is not currently packaged as part of Window Licker, however you can see the code required
